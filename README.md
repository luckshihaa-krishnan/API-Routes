## API ROUTES

#### Published URL : https://luckshihaakrishnan-apiroutes.onrender.com

This application was the first project I did in the course and the main focus in this project is using API (Application Programming Interface) routes. While using API, I added some HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE in order to view, add, update or delete IDs.

- write summary of application
- write steps of running the application  (node server.js) (localhost:3000, or depending on port)

  The possible routes are:

  GET: <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /  <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /api/listings <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /api/listings/:id  <br/>
  POST: <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /api/listings <br/>
  PUT: <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /api/listings/:id <br/>
  DELETE: <br/>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - /api/listings/:id  <br/>
